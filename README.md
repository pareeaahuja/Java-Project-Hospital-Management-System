# Hospital Management System
Java | Data Structures (Queue) | Swing GUI

Overview
This project is a Java-based Hospital Management System designed to manage patient flow efficiently using Data Structures (Queue) and a graphical user interface built with Java Swing.
The system follows the First-In-First-Out (FIFO) principle to ensure fair patient treatment order and provides basic hospital operations such as patient registration, search, treatment, and doctor assignment.
This project is suitable for academic submission, DSA demonstration, and Java GUI application practice.

Key Features

Patient Management
Add patients with name, age, and gender
Search patients by name
Display all patients currently in the queue
Remove patients after treatment

Queue-Based Processing (DSA)
Array-based Queue implementation
FIFO (First-In-First-Out) logic
Handles queue overflow and underflow conditions

Medical Assignment
Disease selection support:
Heart
Brain
Kidney
Cancer
General Checkup
Automatic doctor assignment based on disease type

Graphical User Interface
Interactive Java Swing GUI
Real-time queue visualization
Clean and user-friendly layout
Button-driven operations for ease of use

Technologies Used
Technology	Purpose
Java	Core application logic
Java Swing	Graphical User Interface
Data Structures	Queue for patient management

How the System Works
Patients are added to the system through the GUI.
All patients are stored in a queue.
Patients are treated in FIFO order.
Doctors are assigned automatically based on the selected disease.
Treated patients are removed from the queue.
The updated queue is displayed in real time.

Future Enhancements
Priority Queue for emergency patients
Database integration (MySQL)
User authentication for hospital staff
Appointment scheduling module
